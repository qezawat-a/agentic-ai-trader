"""Account TP/SL - the fourth of the four documented Bitunix TP/SL methods.

Per the official academy article "Bitunix Futures: 4 TP/SL Methods Guide":

    "Account Take-Profit & Stop-Loss | Ideal for Unified Risk Management
     Across Multiple Positions"
    "Instead of monitoring the profit and loss of individual assets, the
     system automatically closes all futures positions once the account's
     overall profit or loss reaches the predefined threshold."

    "Account TP/SL | Whole futures account | All futures positions close"

WHY THIS IS SOFTWARE, NOT AN API CALL
-------------------------------------
Bitunix exposes no REST or WebSocket endpoint for account-level TP/SL. The
official API docs cover exactly two TP/SL families:

    /api/v1/futures/tpsl/position/place_order   -> Position TP/SL (whole position)
    /api/v1/futures/tpsl/place_order            -> standalone TP/SL (tpQty/slQty,
                                                   i.e. the Partial method)

There is no account-scoped endpoint. So this method is implemented in the
engine's management loop: it sums the unrealized PnL of every open position
and, when the total crosses a configured threshold, closes them all.

THE HONEST LIMITATION
---------------------
A software stop only fires while the manage loop is running. If the process is
down, or the loop is stopped, an account-level threshold is NOT enforced by the
exchange. That is a real difference from Position/Partial TP/SL, which the
exchange enforces server-side even when the engine is offline. The engine says
so in `/status` and in the startup banner rather than implying otherwise.
