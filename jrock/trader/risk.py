"""Order-unit conversion, liquidation price, tiered risk limits, position sizing.

Bitunix futures notes (from the official docs + support article):
  * `qty` in place_order is the BASE-COIN amount (e.g. BTC for BTCUSDT), not contracts.
  * `minTradeVolume` / `maxMarketOrderVolume` are base-coin amounts.
  * `basePrecision` = max decimals for qty; `quotePrecision` = max decimals for price.
  * Liquidation (isolated, one-way):
        liq = entry * (1 -/+ 1/leverage + maintenanceMarginRate)   (long / short)
    i.e. long:  liq = entry * (1 - 1/L + mmr)
         short: liq = entry * (1 + 1/L - mmr)
  * Tiered risk: the maintenance margin rate depends on the position notional tier
    (get_position_tiers). Higher notional -> higher mmr -> liquidation closer.
