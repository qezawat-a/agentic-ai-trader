"""Regression tests for the command-bot behaviour fix.

The reported symptom: the agent did nothing unless given an explicit command,
and in ordinary chat it did not understand the user. Two defects produced it:

1. **Greedy command-prefix matching.** `TraderEngine.looks_like_command` was
   `any(low.startswith(p) for p in COMMAND_PREFIXES)`, so a natural sentence
   that merely STARTED with a command word was swallowed by the engine and
   answered with "Unknown engine command" instead of being understood. The
   canonical case: "leverage is too high, what should I do?" starts with
   "leverage" and was treated as the `leverage` setter.

2. **A single-word guard that dropped greetings.** `nlu.parse` returned None
   for any input shorter than two words, so "hi", "thanks", "thx" ... matched
   no rule and the agent answered nothing at all.

Both are pinned here, together with the requirement that REAL commands still
work exactly as before.
